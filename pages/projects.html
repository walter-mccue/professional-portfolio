                        <p>
                            Looking at these two different code blocks, it is easy to tell which one would be easier to read and write.
                            Since graduating from the University, I've learned more modern methods of coding.
                            The first picture is from the capstone class where I wrote very WET (Write Every Time).
                            The second is from a personal project where I used more updated versions of Node, Angular, and MongoDB.
                            That code is known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first picture took 42 lines of code for an API call to "findAllUsers"
                            The second picture used only 24 lines of code to accomplish the same API call.
                            The major difference between the two of them is my use of functions.
                            The first was two separate functions per error/success:
                            one that stored the response from the server and then sent the appropriate data to the client machine,
                            and another that would save the data to either a debug log or error log.
                            On the second picture I used one function for each type error/success and would then subsequently send the appropriate data to the client machine.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Even if you are not familiar with API calls or backend server code, this type of comparison shows my progress and the fact that I am learning.
                            I think that is part of what being in a tech field is all about.
                            Technology is constantly evolving and we need to constantly learn to stay caught up with it.
                            Whether it is current market trends on User Interfaces, or new versions of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript,
                            we should always strive to be up to date with what is going on around us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sorry for the long-winded explanation.
                            If you've read this far, then please scroll down and view a few of my projects that I have been working on in my own time.
                            They've been fun and I've learned even more through the process of completing them.
                        </p>
